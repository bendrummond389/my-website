# My First SvelteKit Website

This website is my very first project built using SvelteKit, a powerful framework for building fast and efficient web applications. It is hosted on Netlify, a cloud-based hosting platform that provides a range of features for deploying and managing web applications.

## Features

My website is a personal portfolio that showcases my skills, experiences, and projects. It features the following pages:

- **Home page:** A brief introduction to myself and my skills.
- **Resume page:** An overview of my professional background, education, and work experiences.
- **Blog page:** A collection of my blog posts, using slugs to display the content dynamically.
- **Contact page:** A form that allows visitors to send me a message directly from the website, utilizing EmailJS for seamless email integration.

To build the user interface of my website, I utilized the Flowbite Svelte UI library. It provides a wide range of customizable UI components, which allowed me to quickly and easily create a modern and responsive design.

The website is built with SvelteKit, which is a highly optimized and performant framework that utilizes server-side rendering, dynamic imports, and other techniques to ensure fast load times and a smooth user experience.

## Hosting

This website is hosted on Netlify, which provides a range of features for deploying and managing web applications. Netlify offers continuous deployment, automatic SSL, and other useful features that make it easy to deploy and manage web applications.

## Credits

This website was built by me, with the help of the SvelteKit framework, Netlify hosting platform, and Flowbite Svelte UI library. Special thanks to the SvelteKit, Netlify, and Flowbite communities for their support and contributions.
