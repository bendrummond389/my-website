		Welcome to my website
	</h5>

	<P size="lg">
		My name is Ben and I'm a Full-Stack Developer
		with experience working on both large-scale
		and small-scale websites. I specialize in
		technologies such as Node.js, React,
		PostgreSQL, and AWS, among others, and I'm
		committed to delivering high-quality products
		that meet my clients' needs and requirements.
		After an initial consultation to discuss
		project requirements, I conduct research,
		create a mockup, and develop a functional
		frontend that matches the mockup. I work
		closely with my clients to tailor the frontend
		until it meets their vision, and then move on
		to the backend development and deployment.
		Throughout the process, I gather feedback and
		make necessary updates until my clients are
		completely satisfied with the final product.

			My interests
		</h5>
		In my free time, I pursue my interests in artificial
		intelligence and embedded systems, which are closely
		related to Web Development. I also enjoy outdoor
		activities such as skiing, surfing, camping, and
		fishing, and spending time with friends. These
		activities help me to recharge and bring new perspectives
		to my work.
